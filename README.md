**RediStack** (pronounced like "ready stack") is a _non-blocking_ Swift client for [Redis](https://redis.io) built on top of [SwiftNIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio).

## Introduction

It communicates over the network using Redis' [**Re**dis **S**eralization **P**rotocol (RESP2)](https://redis.io/topics/protocol).

This library is primarily developed for Redis v5, but is backwards compatible to Redis v3.

## Installing

To install **RediStack**, just add the package as a dependency in your **Package.swift**.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/swift-server/RediStack.git", from: "1.4.1")
]
```

## Getting Started

**RediStack** is quick to use - all you need is an [`EventLoop`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/apple/swift-nio/main/documentation/niocore/eventloop) from **SwiftNIO**.

```swift
import NIOCore
import NIOPosix
import RediStack

let eventLoop: EventLoop = NIOSingletons.posixEventLoopGroup.any()
let connection = RedisConnection.make(
    configuration: try .init(hostname: "127.0.0.1"),
    boundEventLoop: eventLoop
).wait()

let result = try connection.set("my_key", to: "some value")
    .flatMap { return connection.get("my_key") }
    .wait()

print(result) // Optional("some value")
```

> _**Note**: Use of `wait()` was used here for simplicity. Never call this method on an `eventLoop`!_

## Language and Platform Support

Any given release of **RediStack** will support at least the latest version of Swift on a given platform plus **2** previous versions, at the time of the release.

Major version releases will be scheduled around official Swift releases, taking no longer **3 months** from the Swift release.

Major version releases will drop support for any version of Swift older than the last **3** Swift versions.

This policy is to balance the desire for as much backwards compatibility as possible, while also being able to take advantage of new Swift features for the best API design possible.
